## Project Description

Detailed Description
Sales Order is a web application developed to automate the process of handling and tracking sales orders for businesses. This project aims to simplify the complexities involved in order management, customer interaction, and inventory control. An interface where we can create, manage, and monitor sales orders through a system, ensuring efficient order fulfillment and enhanced business operations.

Key Features:

Order Tracking: Sales orders can be tracked from the moment they are created through various filters.

Inventory Control: Integrated with inventory systems to automatically update stock levels upon order creation and fulfillment, preventing issues like stockouts or over-ordering.

Detailed Reports: Generate reports that provide insights into sales trends, inventory status, and customer preferences, which can aid in decision-making and business strategy formulation.

Order Editing and Deletion: Sales orders can be modified or canceled, depending on the business requirement, and updates are reflected across all related systems.

Technologies Utilized:
Backend: Spring Boot is used for building the RESTful API, handling data processing, and managing business logic related to sales orders.
Database:
MongoDB: For storing unstructured data such as product reviews, ratings, and customer feedback.
MySQL: Used for managing structured data such as sales orders, customers, and inventory information.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Thymeleaf are used to create dynamic and responsive web pages for users to interact with the system.
Security: Spring Security is implemented to manage authentication and authorization, ensuring only authorized users can access or modify sales order data.
Version Control: GitHub is used to manage and track changes to the project source code.
